# 1. Conceptual Overview

This document outlines the high-level concept, purpose, and functionality of the GraffitiXR web application.

### **What it is**
This is a web application that uses the device's camera to project an image onto a wall or other surface. It allows the user to see how a mural or other artwork would look in a real-world environment before it is created.

### **What it's for**
The main purpose of this application is to help artists, designers, and homeowners visualize how a mural or other large-scale artwork will look in a specific location. It can be used to test different images, sizes, and placements without the need for physical mockups.

### **Operational Modes**
The application offers three distinct modes:

1.  **Image Trace Mode:** The application overlays a semi-transparent image onto the live camera feed. This mode is designed for artists who wish to trace a design onto a physical surface, assuming the device is held in a fixed position (e.g., on a tripod).
2.  **Mock-Up Mode:** This mode allows a user to visualize artwork on a static background image (e.g., a photo of a wall). The user can apply a four-point perspective warp to the overlay image to make it fit the surface realistically.
3.  **AR Overlay Mode:** This is the flagship mode that uses augmented reality to project the user's artwork onto real-world surfaces detected by the device's camera. It provides the most immersive and realistic visualization.
