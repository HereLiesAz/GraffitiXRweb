# 9. Authentication

This document outlines the authentication and user management strategy for the GraffitiXR web application.

---

## **Current Status: Not Implemented**

Currently, the GraffitiXR web application does not include any user authentication or account management features. All functionality is available to any user who accesses the application.

### **Future Considerations**

If user accounts are added in the future, this document will be updated to include details on:

-   The authentication provider (e.g., Firebase Auth, Auth0, custom backend).
-   The user data model.
-   The login and registration workflows.
-   Protected routes and authorization logic.
-   The strategy for managing user sessions and tokens.
