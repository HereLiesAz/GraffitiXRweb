# 5. Performance Considerations

This document outlines key performance considerations and optimization strategies for the GraffitiXR web application. As a real-time, camera-based application, maintaining a smooth user experience is critical.

### **Threading and Asynchronous Operations**

All computationally heavy tasks must be moved off the main UI thread to prevent blocking, which can cause the interface to freeze or become unresponsive.

-   **Web Workers:** For intensive background processing, such as the computer vision analysis required for the AR stabilization feature, **Web Workers** should be used. This will allow the OpenCV feature tracking to run in a separate thread without impacting the responsiveness of the main application.
-   **Asynchronous Code:** Standard JavaScript features like `async/await` and `Promises` should be used for all I/O operations, such as fetching data or loading images, to ensure the UI remains fluid.

### **Rendering Efficiency**

-   **Hardware Acceleration:** The application should leverage hardware acceleration wherever possible. In the AR mode, this is handled by the browser's WebXR implementation which uses WebGL. For the 2D modes, the HTML `<canvas>` element is hardware-accelerated in modern browsers.
-   **Memoization:** To prevent unnecessary re-renders in React, `React.memo` should be used for components, and `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks should be used to memoize functions and values that are passed as props. This is especially important in a real-time application where state may update frequently.
-   **Efficient Drawing:** When using the Canvas API (as in Mock-Up mode), draw operations should be batched where possible. Avoid unnecessarily complex operations on the main thread during the render loop.

### **Memory Management**

While JavaScript has automatic garbage collection, it's still possible to introduce memory leaks.

-   **Object References:** Ensure that large objects, especially those containing image or video data, are not held in memory longer than necessary. Set references to `null` when they are no longer needed to allow the garbage collector to reclaim the memory.
-   **Event Listeners:** Always clean up event listeners in React components using the `useEffect` cleanup function. Dangling event listeners are a common source of memory leaks.
-   **Canvas Memory:** When working with large canvases, be mindful of the memory footprint. If a canvas is no longer needed, remove it from the DOM and clear any references to it.

### **WebXR / AR Performance**

-   **Frame Rate:** The target frame rate for the AR experience should be consistently high (ideally 60fps) to prevent motion sickness and provide a smooth experience.
-   **Anchor Management:** In the AR Overlay mode, if the underlying WebXR API supports it, anchors that are no longer in use should be detached from the session to reduce the tracking overhead.
-   **Complexity:** The complexity of the 3D scene should be kept to a minimum. In this application, the scene only contains a simple quad for the image overlay, which is very efficient.
